Thereâ€™s nothing wicked about this â€” most of us remain the victims of our worst teachers all our lives. And we pass on whatever nonsense we believed. But Kingâ€™s self-story is FAR more valuable, because it is not prescriptive at all. He simply tells us what happened and why, and thatâ€™s true storytelling.',
